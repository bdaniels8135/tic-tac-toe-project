# Tic Tac Toe Project

This is an assignment from the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

The [project brief](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe) outlines the original expectations.

I decided to come back and rework this project into a React App after starting to learn that framework/library.

I have also learned about responsive design and accessability since my original submission.

I will try to work those ideas into the updated project as well.

Check out the [live preview](https://bdaniels8135.github.io/tic-tac-toe-project/) and see if you can beat the master!
